This will be a community-driven server so feel free to suggest new text channels, better server names, nice logos, or anything else you think would improve it for everyone. Roles are being created for mods, trusted users, etc. As with all communities, we have a few rules to keep things friendly.

1. **Respect other users of this server.** We’re all on the same team here so let’s have fun, share what we know, and hopefully learn something new. No bullying, harassment, racism, or sexism. Censoring yourself with * is also not allowed. Memes included. Generally, just be excellent to each other.

2. **Use the relevant text channel.** Channels are grouped by category, if you're new to here, you might introduce yourself at <channel name="introductions" />. If you need help, please try to find a relevant channel, eg: use <channel name="vuex" /> for vuex questions, otherwise post it in <channel name="need-help" />. If you want to share your project, use <channel name="i-made-this" />, etc. If you can't not find a relevant channel then put it in <channel name="general" /> or ask admin to create a new text channel.

3. **Don’t be afraid to ask.** There’s not such thing as a stupid question. We’re here to learn and we encourage people to ask questions about anything Vue related. However it would save both you and the others a good amount of time if you format your message correctly and reference a link to codepen.io / codesandbox.io whenever possible, <channel name="discord-help" /> is here in case you have any furthur questions regarding discord usage.

4. **No spam.** Nobody likes spam so let’s keep this server clean and relevant. Duplicated messages and ads might be deleted.
